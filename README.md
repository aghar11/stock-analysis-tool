# Stock Chart Technical Pattern Matching Tool
**This tool is still under development**

This tool will accept a stock ticker as an input and analyse the stock based on 3 key criteria, and present the found data in an intuitive way to the user. 
The criteria that tbe tool will consider are:
1. Technical Pattern Matching
2. Stock Technicals Analysis
3. Market Sentiment Analysis

For the first iteration of devlopment, the focus will be on technical pattern matching for a provided stock and the other criteria will be added in following development cycles. The end goal of the tool will be to analyze the specifc stock, industry, or index, and aggregate and present data in an easy to understand way that users can then use to base their investment decsisions on.

## Basic Plan 
### 1. Define Your Scope and Requirements
Input: Stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
Output: Best-matching technical stock patterns (like Head and Shoulders, Double Top/Bottom, etc.). (Current Goal)
Timeframe: Analyze data for the past month to date
### 2. Collect and Prepare Data
Stock Market Data: Use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or IEX Cloud to collect historical price data (open, high, low, close, volume).
Data Cleaning: Ensure the data is complete and handle missing values, outliers, etc.
Big Data Considerations: When dealing with a large number of tickers over many years, we will consider using distributed computing tools like Spark or Hadoop to handle data efficiently.
### 3. Select the Right Tools and Frameworks
Data Collection: Use Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, or requests to fetch and handle data.
Pattern Recognition: Leverage technical analysis libraries like TA-Lib, backtrader, or pandas-ta to compute and analyze technical indicators.
Machine Learning: Use classification algorithms (like Decision Trees or Neural Networks) to detect patterns in stock data.
### 4. Data Storage and Management
Database: Use a time-series database like InfluxDB or traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL to store analysed stocks and the analysis output data.
### 5. Data Visualization
Use tools like matplotlib, plotly, or seaborn to visualize stock price movements and pattern matches.
Add visual indicators of matched patterns over stock charts.
### 6. Pattern Matching Algorithm
Implement pattern-matching algorithms for technical patterns like Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Retracements, and common chart patterns.
Explore libraries like scikit-learn for more advanced pattern classification based on historical trends and performance.
### 7. Testing and Refinement
Test tool with historical data and compare the predictions/pattern matches with actual stock performance.
Refine the algorithms to improve pattern accuracy.
### 8. Deployment
The tool will start as a local command line tool.

**Future Deployment Goals**

Deploy the tool on the cloud using Docker and set up an API that accepts stock tickers, and returns the analysis. Pair API with a simple hosted frontend where users can input a ticker, and the returned analysis is displayed.
